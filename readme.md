# Duplii Bubble Bursting Animation

**Warning: highly hypnotic!**

This is the animation we will use inside [Duplii](http://duplii.com/ "Duplii | We Make Duplication Happen") whenever we want to celebrate something with the user.

It basically creates semi-random bubbles that grow, move and explode.

The code is built in Sass and vanilla JavaScript: no jQuery, no libraries, no dependencies whatsoever. If you have a (modern) browser, you can gaze at them exploding and magically reappearing.

I put in a bucketful of comments, so it should be pretty easy to follow along with the code.

I am also including the `config.codekit` file so that everyone using Codekit will be able to get started immediately.

**Woooo! Bubble bursting time!**
